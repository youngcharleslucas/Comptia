# Comptia A+ Core 1  

## Fundamentals  
* b means bit, B means bytes. 
	- So 200 Mbps = 200,000,000 bits per second
	- 4 MB = 4,000,000 B x 8 bits = 32,000,000 bits  
* **Throughput unit** 
	- Kbps, Mbps, Gbps, Tbps all per second    
* **Processing Speed**  
	- Frequency of electrical cycles per second
	- MHz, GHz  
* Devices  
	- The old mouse and keyboard connection to computers (round with pins) was called a PS2 connection  
	- CMOS = BIOS chip  
	- Chipset: directs the communication between the processor and rame  
* Storage types  
	- Local Network  
		- NAS - Network Attached Storage  
		- File Server 
		- Local Cloud
	- Remote Network  
		- Cloud
